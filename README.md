## Data Structures

This is the collection of all the codes I practiced for stregthening my data structures.
In my opinion, this is more than sufficient for most of the coding interview questions which
are related to DS. **Find a PDF that contains entire content of this repo with diagrams and explanations wherever required.**

Following is the overview of the topics covered in this repo:

**Module 1: Arrays**

Two major sections covered in this module are _array rotations_ and _sorting_. 

**Module 2: Linked Lists**

The first section gives an extensive coverage of topics of _Singly Linked List_.
And then the section of _Other Linked Lists_ covers the overview of Circular  and 
Doubly Linked Lists.

**Module 3: Stacks**

One section on _Stacks_ is there covering it's bare-bones implementation, design 
questions and applications of stacks. 

**Module 4: Queues**

Similar to Stacks, one section on _Queues_ covers it's bare-bones implementation,
design questions and applications of queues.

**Module 5: Trees**

This module spans across many sections. First section of _Introduction to Binary Trees_ 
introduces the basic concepts and definitions of Trees. Then _BT Traversal and BT Construction Problems_ 
provide a sufficient practice of working with trees. A very important concept is then introduced
in the section of _Least Common Ancestor_ followed by some _Miscellaneous Problems_. 

We then introduce a two important variants of Binary Trees - _Binary Search Trees (BSTs)_ and _Heaps_. 

A small introduction of _AVL Trees_ is also provided at the end.

**Module 6: Graphs**

Finally, the most important and the biggest module of Data structures - Graphs! Topics covered 
under this module are - _Graph Traversals and Basic Terminology, Cycles in Graph, Minimum Spanning Trees, Shortes Path Algorithms, Concept of Connectivity, Topological Sorting and Flow in Graphs._ 

**_After you feel comfortable with Data-Structures, you should definitely go for 'ALGORITHMS' and try 'COMPETITIVE PROGRAMMING' as well._**
